# Introduction to the JSON APIs and AJAX Challenges #

与用户界面如何帮助人们使用程序类似，应用编程接口（APIs）可以帮助程序与其他程序交互。APIs 是计算机相互通信的工具，部分用于发送和接受数据。当你理解如何从中发送请求和处理数据后，你就可以在你的页面中使用 API 功能了，通常上程序员们在使用 API 时 使用 AJAX 技术。

AJAX 术语 起源于 Asynchronous JavaScript And XML 的首字母缩写。它指的是一组技术，它们向服务器发出异步请求以传输数据，然后将返回的数据加载到页面中。一个异步的进程有几个关键属性，浏览器不会停止加载页面来等待服务器的相应。此外，浏览器无需刷新整个页面就可以将更新的数据插入页面。

User experience benefits from asynchronous processes in several ways. Pages load faster since the browser isn't waiting for the server to respond in the middle of a page render. Requests and transfers happen in the background, without interrupting what the user is doing. When the browser receives new data, only the necessary area of the page refreshes. These qualities especially enhance the user experience for single page applications.

The data transferred between the browser and server is often in a format called JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). JSON resembles JavaScript object literal syntax, except that it's transferred as a string. Once received, it can be converted into an object and used in a script.

Similar to how User Interfaces help people use programs, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) help programs interact with other programs. APIs are tools that computers use to communicate with one another, in part to send and receive data. You can use API functionality in your page once you understand how to make requests and process data from it. Programmers often use AJAX technologies when working with APIs.

The term AJAX originated as an acronym for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. It refers to a group of technologies that make asynchronous requests to a server to transfer data, then load any returned data into the page. An asynchronous process has a couple key properties. The browser does not stop loading a page to wait for the server's response. Also, the browser inserts updated data into part of the page without having to refresh the entire page.
