# Introduction to the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects #

Time to put your new JavaScript skills to work! These challenges will be similar to the algorithm scripting challenges but more difficult. This will allow you to prove how much you have learned.

In this section you will create the following small JavaScript programs:

* Roman Numeral Converter

* Caesars Cipher

* Telephone Number Validator

* Cash Register

Have fun and remember to use the Read-Search-Ask method if you get stuck.

Good Luck!
